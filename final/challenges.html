                            I love this book because it shows the diversity of queerness. 
                            It portrayed the experience of being in a 'straght' friend group only for everyone to come out. (Happened to me. Twice.).
                            I also love that it isn't hyperfocused on romance.

                            This book features two lesbians (an identity I don't share).
                            It was written by a wife duo, and everything was so lovely.
                            I liked that it explored deeper themes in a way that didn't feel performative, yet still remained true to its romcom roots.
