					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> There were so many nitty gritty details that I did not realize were really important to the user experience.
								For example, the different rates of different objects was interesting. 
							I liked how it talked about mirroring how objects would move in the real world to makae the animations feel more natural. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was the side by side comparisons.
								There is so much I take forgranted when it comes to the user experience of my devices.
							The side by side really showed me what life could have been like. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> Not a quote, but the graphic showing the different dots easing in at different rates was cool </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
