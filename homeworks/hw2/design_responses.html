					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that whitespace and padding is essential to organizing a website. Without whitespace, 
								the user would get overwhelemd too quickly. With whitespace, you can adequately direct the user's attention.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article were the side by side comparisons. It really shows what we take forgranted 
								about whitespace. I also liked the small detail they said about everything being a multiple of 8. It shows
							how much detail and thought goes into web design. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Think you're using too much white space? There's a good chance you're not." </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
