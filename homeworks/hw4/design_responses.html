						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned what the appropriate ratio of color contrast is. 
								I did not know that there was an industry standard when it came to to this.
							The examples did a good job of demonstrating what that ratio looks like when it's implemented. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part was the examples of images that they gave. 
								There were so many ways to make websites accessible that went beyond color.
								I especially liked the bar graph illustration that demonstrated the importance of texture.  </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Color accessibility requires a little up-front work when selecting your product's color palette, but ensuring your colors are accessible will pay dividends down the road"</p>
						</li>
