                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> I learned how animations can keep someone on a page for longer. 
                                Some of the animations were a couple of seconds long, requiring the user to spend more time on the site to get all the appropriate information.
                                I thought that this was really effective </p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p> My favorite part of the article was that there was a mix of examples.
                                Some were desktop view, and others were mobile.
                                It really helped in thinking about websites beyond the desktop, which we have primarily been focusing on. </p>

                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> I liked the landing page concept from Anton Mikhaltsov. 
                                I thought it was simple (which made me feel like I could one day achieve something like this), but it was also exciting.
                                The color theme was really fun and playful, and I think added to the animations.
                                Overall, an engaging site I hope I will be able to one day recreate. </p>

                            <p>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much did you enjoy reading this article? Please briefly explain why.</p>
                            <p> 5. I thought the layout was overcrowded, plus I wish there was more text explaining some of the techniques used
                                and how it fits into design goals. </p>
