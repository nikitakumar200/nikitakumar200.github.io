					<ul>
						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned that people can spend their entire careers on typography. 
								That was really surprising to me because I only really think about fonts in something like Google Docs, 
								and I basically exclusively use Times New Roman. 
								So the fact that there's a whole design theory around it that people can study is really cool! </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of the article was the free font resources they linked. 
								I spent an inordinate amount of time looking at them. My favorite has to be Alcubierre. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Font pairing is just as important as the fonts themselves. 
								Good font pairing helps establish visual hierarchy and improve the readability of your designs." </p>
						</li>
