            <li> One thing I learned from this article is how slight changes in wording can change user experience</li>
            <li> My favorite parts of the article were the gifs. Helps give frame of reference.</li>
            <li> This is an interesting quote from the article: "By routinely analyzing other apps, youâ€™ll develop your product thinking and get better at designing apps yourself."</li>
